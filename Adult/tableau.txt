1. Histogram: Age Distribution by Salary
✅ Correct, but note:

Use age as a binned field.

CNT(adult.csv) = Tableau auto count of records.

Issue: The salary values aren't consistently formatted (e.g., <=50K, 67K, 23K, etc.). This field needs cleaning to group into >50K and <=50K.

2. Scatter Plot: Capital Gain vs. Hours per Week
✅ Correct setup.

⚠️ Make sure capitalgain is numeric — it is currently stored as a string, so convert it to numeric in Tableau or Python.

Add linear trend line via Analytics → Trend Line → Linear.

3. Heatmap: Occupation vs. Marital Status
⚠️ Column name in your CSV is maritial-status (note the typo).

✅ Fix: Use maritial-status instead of marital-status.

4. Bubble Chart: Age, Hours/Week, Capital Gain
✅ Correct in logic.

⚠️ Clean and ensure capitalgain is numeric.

✅ Gender is appropriate for color coding.

5. Line Chart: Observation Order vs. Capital Gain
✅ Correct.

⚠️ Ensure capitalgain is treated as numeric.

Use Tableau’s INDEX() as a calculated field.

6. Parallel Coordinates Plot
✅ Correct approach but requires normalization (Tableau doesn’t support this directly; you must pre-process or use calculated fields).

7. Treemap: Workclass → Occupation → Salary
✅ Hierarchy logic is correct.

⚠️ Again, salary needs to be categorized properly (clean irregular formats).

✅ Use AVG(capitalgain) and color by salary.

8. Network Visualization (Workaround)
✅ Reasonable workaround using Tableau Prep or Excel.

⚠️ You’d need to manually create a source-target table (not available in raw CSV).
