1. 1D Visualizations (Single Variable)
A. Histogram: Age Distribution by Salary
Steps:

Drag age to Columns.

Click "Show Me" → Histogram.

Drag salary to Color.

Right-click x-axis → Edit Bins → Set to 5-year intervals.

Insight: Compare age distributions for high (>50K) vs. low (<=50K) earners.

B. Bar Chart: Education Levels Count
Steps:

Drag education to Columns.

Drag CNT(education) to Rows.

Sort bars: Right-click x-axis → Sort → Descending.

2. 2D Visualizations (Two Variables)
A. Scatter Plot: Capital Gain vs. Hours per Week
Steps:

Drag capitalgain to Columns.

Drag hoursperweek to Rows.

Drag salary to Color.

Add trend line: Analytics pane → Trend Line → Linear.

Insight: High capital gain often correlates with higher working hours.

B. Heatmap: Occupation vs. Marital Status
Steps:

Drag occupation to Columns.

Drag marital-status to Rows.

Drag CNT(occupation) to Color.

Adjust color gradient: Click Color → Edit Colors.

3. 3D Visualization (Workaround)
Bubble Chart: Age, Hours/Week, Capital Gain
Steps:

Drag age to Columns.

Drag hoursperweek to Rows.

Drag capitalgain to Size.

Drag gender to Color.

Why? Size encodes a third dimension (capital gain).

4. Temporal Visualization (Simulated)
Line Chart: "Observation Order vs. Capital Gain"
Steps:

Create calculated field Observation Order:

INDEX()
Drag Observation Order to Columns.

Drag capitalgain to Rows.

Drag workclass to Color.

Insight: Simulates trends in capital gain across records.

5. Multidimensional Visualization
Parallel Coordinates Plot
Steps:

Normalize 4+ measures (e.g., age, educationnum, capitalgain, hoursperweek) to 0–1 scale.

Drag Measure Names to Columns.

Drag Normalized Values to Rows.

Drag salary to Color.

Insight: Compares multiple variables across salary groups.

6. Tree/Hierarchical Visualization
Treemap: Workclass → Occupation → Salary
Steps:

Create hierarchy: Right-click workclass → Hierarchy → Add occupation.

Drag hierarchy to Columns/Rows.

Drag AVG(capitalgain) to Size, salary to Color.

Click "Show Me" → Treemap.

Why? Shows earnings distribution across workclass-occupation groups.

7. Network Visualization (Workaround)
Node-Link: "Occupation Relationships"
Steps:

Create a source-target table in Tableau Prep (link occupations sharing common education levels).

Use "Relationship" field as edges.

Drag occupation to Detail, CNT(occupation) to Size.

Use "Filled Map" mark type with curved paths.

Insight: Artificial network showing occupation-education ties.
